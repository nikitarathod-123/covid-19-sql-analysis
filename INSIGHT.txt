# COVID-19 DATA ANALYSIS PROJECT

A Basic Beginner Project to analyze and visualize Covid-19 data of three initial months From 04/01/2020 To 23/03/2020

The purpose of this project was learning and implementing the basic concepts of MySQL and Python

-------------------------------------
## Data Source

- Data was sourced from online WHO Data website.
-------------------------------------
## Tools Used

- MySQL Workbench (for sql queries)
- Thonny IDE (for visualization)
- Python libraries: 
    ~ pandas (reading csv files)
    ~ matplotlib (visualizing data)
    ~ mysql-connector-python (using queries in python)
-------------------------------------
## Insights Drawn From Data

- China reported maximum number of cases
- Italy reported maximum number of deaths (5476)
- Spain is the country with the overall highest number of New_cases and New_deaths reported
- Blank values in New_cases and New_deaths were replaced with 0.
- All numerical columns converted to integer type.
- India's daily new cases and deaths visualized using bar chart.
--------------------------------------
## Concepts covered

- SQL & Database Interaction
- Data Cleaning and Transformation
- Data Analysis
- Python Programming
- Data Visualization
-------------------------------------
# Files Included
- `who-covid-19-data.csv` – Dataset used for analysis
- `covid-19-analysis_queries.sql` – SQL queries for analysis
- `india_visualization_.png` – Bar graph visualizing new cases and deaths in India
- `INSIGHT.txt` – Short description of the project
> Python code is **not uploaded** to keep database credentials private.
-------------------------------------
# SQL Concepts Applied
- `GROUP BY`
- `ORDER BY`
- `IS NULL` and other null handling
- Aggregate functions (`SUM()`, `MAX()`, etc.)
- Subqueries
-------------------------------------
## Future Improvements

- Add time series analysis
- Include more countries or time periods
- Use seaborn/plotly for advanced visualizations
- A better readme file to explain how to run code
- Managing the database credentials
